# Cpp-snippets

![C++ master race](assets/gcc.png?raw=true "gcc")

C++ for Machine Learning, Statistics and in general Data Science methods. I will avoid, as much as I can, the use of other libraries. The porpouse of this repository is to give a easy to understand resource for algorithms implementations, using only an implementation from scratch.

With that said, I want to clarify that the use of these codes is not convinient in any real world problem (for that already exist tons of wonderfull libraries), I only reccomend it to studie porpouses.

I have done this to my better understanding, but I made it public in case that this code could help someone else to understand an algorithm.
